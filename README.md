# The warmup project

## Objectives


The main objective of this project is to typeset the notes for a short
course on multivariate calculus taught at IME-USP in 2008 by professor
[Alexandre Lymberopoulos][0]. These notes are in Portuguese.

The typing and picture programming work is done by [Régis Santos][3]
using [LaTeX][1] typesetting system and [TikZ][2] for generating the
pictures.

## Text Organization

A primary intention of this text is to provide a quick introduction to
calculus, mainly the differential part. Integration is covered briefly
in the last chapter.

* Chapter 1: Revision of one-variable calculus (nice approach on
  derivatives)

* Chapter 2: Curves in euclidean space, limits and
  continuity of real valued functions.

* Chapter 3: Multivariate derivatives and applications

* Chapter 4: Maximum and minimum of functions

* Chapter 5: Vector Fields

* Chapter 6: Integration: double and triple integrals, line integrals
  and conservative fields.

* Apendix: The course tests and their solutions.
